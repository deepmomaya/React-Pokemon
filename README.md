# React Pokémon Viewer

A web app built with React and the PokeAPI. Users can browse the first 20 Pokémon, view their names and links, and click to reveal detailed information including images, abilities, moves, and weight. The React frontend provides a clean, interactive interface while API calls dynamically fetch Pokémon data for display.
